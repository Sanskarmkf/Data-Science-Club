1. Accept two integers and a character (+, -, *, /) from the user, and use a switch to perform the operation.

2. Write a program that takes a grade (A, B, C, D, F) and uses switch to print a message (e.g., A = "Excellent", B = "Good", etc.).

3. Predict the output of the following program: 
	String day = "MONDAY";
	switch (day.toLowerCase()) {
	    case "monday":
	        System.out.println("Start of the week");
	        break;
	    case "friday":
	        System.out.println("Weekend is near!");	
	        break;
	    default:
	        System.out.println("Midweek");
	}

4. Write a program to print even numbers from 1 to 100 using a while loop.

5. Write a program to reverse a number (e.g., input: 1234, output: 4321) using a while loop.

6. Keep asking the user to guess a number until they get it right. Use a do-while loop.

7. Create a menu (1. Add, 2. Subtract, 3. Exit) and perform the selected operation using a do-while loop. (For exiting from the code in java, we use System.exit())

8. Write a program that takes a number and calculates its factorial using a for loop.

9. Take a number and print its multiplication table up to 10 using a for loop.

10. Predict the output of the following code: 
	for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
	    if (i == 3) break;
	    System.out.print(i + " ");
	}

11. Given an integer array, use a for-each loop to find the sum of all elements.

12. Given an array of integers, use a for-each loop to find and print the largest number.
