1. Predict the output the code snipsset given below:
	class Sample1{
        public static void main(String[] args){
                int x = 10;
                if(!(x==10))
                        System.out.println("Hello");
                else
                        System.out.println("Hi");
        }
}

2. Create a class named 'Student' with data members: String variable 'name' and integer variable 'roll_no'. Assign the value of roll_no as '2' and that of name as "John" by creating an object of the class Student and display the same.

3. Write a program that would print the information (name, year of joining, salary, address) of an employee by creating a class named 'Employee'. 

4. Predict the output of the following program: 
	class Company {
		String name;
	}
	class Main {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			Company c1 = new Company();
			c1.name = "Acharya";
			System.out.println(c1.name);
		}
	}

5. Check if a number is positive
   Input: an integer
   Task: Print "Positive number" if it's greater than 0.

6. Check if a character is a vowel
   Input: a character
   Task: Print "Vowel" if the character is 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u'.

7. Check if a number is even or odd
   Input: an integer
   Task: Print "Even" if it's divisible by 2, otherwise print "Odd".

8. Check if a number is positive and even
   Input: an integer
   Task: First check if it's positive, then check if it's even.

9. Check grades based on marks
   Input: integer marks
   Task:

   If marks > 90, print "Excellent"

   If 70 < marks ≤ 90, print "Good"

   Else, print "Needs Improvement"

10. Determine the type of triangle
   Input: three sides of a triangle
   Task:

   If all sides are equal → "Equilateral"

   If two sides are equal → "Isosceles"

   If no sides are equal → "Scalene"
